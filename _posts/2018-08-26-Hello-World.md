Well, Just got Jekyll up and running.
Honestly, I don't really like Ruby, I'm more of a Python kind of guy.
That being said, I prefer Scala over Both.
So here's a "Hello, World!" in Scala.

{% highlight scala %}
object HelloWorld {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = println("Hello, World!")
}
{% endhighlight %}
