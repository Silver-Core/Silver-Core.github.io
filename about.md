<!-- 
  `about` is the only thing I cant really manipulate.
  So I'm forced to just html-ify it until I think of a
  better solution.
  Just look at all the `<br>`s!

Hi, I like cake. <br>
Not cake patterns, Those are atrocious. <br>
<br>

Anyway, This cake is great; it's so delicious and moist!
<br>Look at me still talking when there's (computer) science to do.
   <br>When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you.
     <br>I have experiments to run,
      <br>There is research to be done,
        <br>On the people who are still alive.

Portal references aside, I'm a lazy (+ good for nothing) programmer. <br>
I usually enjoy writing in either Scala, Python and occasionally Rust; <br>
But I know other languages too (Namely Java).<br>

I'm not working on anything at the moment, But if I ever do it'll be posted
somewhere in this blog. <br>
